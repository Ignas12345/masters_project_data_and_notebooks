1) TCGA_TGCT_sample_data.csv - this is a supplementary file from https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(18)30785-X and contains various meta data about the samples.
2) TCGA_TGCT_divisions_by_experiment.csv - this contains the divisions of the samples by experiment, according to differentially abundant miRNA experiment in https://www.cell.com/cms/10.1016/j.celrep.2018.05.039/attachment/c0b32f0d-2761-4f95-b667-b6fe9350049c/mmc1.pdf; this was prepared using the notebook in "Notebooks/data_download_and_preparation/TCGA_TGCT_divide_data_according_to_condition.ipynb"
3) TCGA_all_studies_sample_clin_data.csv - this contains some clinical data for all TCGA samples (including those from other studies than TCGA). This can be used to prepare an experiment to classify TGCTs in general. The notebook used for this is at "Notebooks/data_download_and_preparation/TCGA_clinical_data_download.ipynb"
4) TCGA_TGCT_clin_data.csv - this contains clinical data for TGCT patients downloaded using TCGABiolinks. It can contain errors, so should rely on it less than on "TCGA_TGCT_sample_data.csv". Downloaded using: "Notebooks/data_download_and_preparation/prepare_experiment_by_clin_stage_and_non_TGCT_samples.ipynb"
5) TCGA_TGCT_division_by_stage.csv - prepared using : "Notebooks/data_download_and_preparation/prepare_experiment_by_clin_stage_and_non_TGCT_samples.ipynb"
6) filtered_other_tcga_patients_clin_data.csv - this is a file with clinical data for TCGA patients that are male, not from the TGCT study and follow an age distribution that is similar to TGCT patients. It is quite arbitrary and might not neccessarily need to be used. Prepared using: "Notebooks/data_download_and_preparation/prepare_experiment_by_clin_stage_and_non_TGCT_samples.ipynb"
